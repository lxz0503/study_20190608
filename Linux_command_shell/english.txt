But sometimes I also provide technical support for customers if they are not clear about the useage of our products.


======what sorts of things do you do at work?

Before we release a software product to customers, I must do system test, which needs reviewing code,making comments and setting up test environment.

Finally I will give a detailed test report for this new product.Sometimes, if the customer is not clear about the usage, I also provide technical support through email or telephone.

====================Is work important to you?====

Yes, I think so. Work provides me with an income to support my family.You know I have a baby.

Also I can gain satisfaction and achievement in my work,especially after I resolve a tough issue.

When others are late, if they have sound(legitimate) reasons, I can understand. I know sometimes the traffic condition is really bad.

If I am a manager, I will punish him or her to sing a song for us.

people want to remember. 

====Do you keep your old  photos?

Maybe one day, I can show my old photos to my daughter and say "look,your father has been to this place when he was young".

People aroud all love this dog.

But you know the housing price is very high and I can not afford a house.

=====what do you think of the area in which you live?   do you like the surrounding area?

Well, it is very convenient because there are several covenience stores,hospital, and bus stop.
Also it is not very far from the subway station.

But the disadvantage is obvious, it is a little noisy and sometimes I can not sleep well.

====how long have you lived there?

Well, I have lived here for more than 4 years. I like here because of its natural environment.There are enough green space, also a beautiful river right beside my community.

But it is a little far way from my work space.So,I am planing to move to the urban area.

====what are your neighbours like?

The best kind of education最好的教育

“There is much debate as to the best kind of education for students today.
Some think private schools are tops. A lot of money goes into these schools and the programs are usually of a high quality,
yet the tuition fees are often more than the average person can afford.
Others think that given a good administration and teachers who care, public schools can offer good educations as well.
One problem is that classes in public schools tend to have many more students than private schools,
and therefore individual attention can sometimes suffer.
Generally, however, quality is based on the individual schools and student interests
rather than whether the schools are publicly or privately funded.”

List of Materials That Are Recyclable

firstly we should know what materials are recyclable.

Newspapers, office paper, magazines and cardboard,
You can even recycle gift wrapping paper if it doesn't have a plastic film coating on the top

Paper recycling may be one of the easiest and most common forms of recycling

There are two major categories of metal recycling: aluminum and steel.
For aluminum, think soda cans. Steel cans often store soups, sauces, beans or fruit.
The lids of these cans are also recyclable.
If you aren't sure how to tell them apart,
remember this: Steel cans are magnetic, aluminum cans are not.

Plastics are often the most confusing type of recyclable material.
What do those numbers on the bottom of the container mean, anyway? Let's break it down.

The important take-away is that not all plastics are recyclable materials.
The symbols on the bottom of plastic containers tell us what type of plastic resin makes up the container.
The most commonly seen and recyclable plastics are #1 (PET: clear plastics, like water and soda bottles),
#2 (HDPE: usually more opaque plastics, like laundry soap and milk jugs),
and #5 (yogurt, butter, sour cream containers).

-------------2019.11.6  IELTS writing--
whether child should use cell phone, some advocate and some oppose. discuss both and give your opinion.

Nowadays,cell phone is very popular in people's daily lives.
It seems that people even can not live without cell phones.
Some people hold the view that children should also own their cell phones.Others,however,
hold the opposite point. This essay will examine this issue and come to a conclusion.

Admittedly,smartphones can bring a great deal of benefits to people,including children.
They can communicate effectively and efficiently with their parents,friends and teachers.
This is particularly necessary when considering into the fact that now teachers tend to assign tasks to students through some Apps,
such as Wechat or Skype. If children do not have smartphones, they may not receive the assignments in time and affect their study.
In addition,the functions of cell phone are not limited to making calls,sending text messages or listening to music.
They often support the new feature of locating,which is very helpful for children's safety.For example,if a child is lost,
the parents,police officers and teachers are able to know where the child is and can rush to the place.

Clearly smartphones can bring many conveniences to children's lives and study,but it is important to figure out the demerits of using cell phones.
To begin with,children can easily use smartphones to access to the Internet which is awash with violent,bloody and obscene videos and images.
Children are too immature to distinguish right from wrong,so they tend to copy what they see on the cell phones,which may lead them to go astray.
In addition,some children often spend too much time playing mobile games on their smartphones,which can easily cause eyestrain and headache and do harm to
their physical development.What is worse,according to the statistics,children's free time is occupied mostly by smartphones
and this will inevitably affect the family bonds,because they are more likely to communicate with family members through cell phones
rather than face-to-face communication.

To sum up,from what has been discussed above,we can safely draw the conclusion that cell phone is very helpful to children,but we still can not
overlook the disadvantages it would bring.As a result,my opinion is that children can use smartphones while at the same time parents and teachers must
give strict control and proper instructions to guide them to use cell phones in the right way.

===========================you, as a tenant,write a letter to the landlord about the water issue.
Dear Jack,

I am writing this letter to inform you of the water issue in your apartment.

I have been living here for more than one month and everything is perfect.But since last Friday,something unexpected had happened.
I switched on the faucet just as usual and wanted to wash my socks.To my surprise,the color of the water was yellow and it was smelly.
I was a bit scared.I thought there might be something wrong with the water system and it would be ok later.So I went to work and ignored it.
When I returned home from work,I found the water still did not come back to normal.

I quickly confirmed with my neighbors and they said their water system were normal.I also made a call to the water company and they replied that there was nothing
wrong with the water source.So, I had to check the water system in your kitchen and finally found an advanced water purified system just beside the water source.
Maybe there was something wrong with the water purifier and it spoiled the water.

As you may know,I have to make meals and wash clothes every day,which both need to use water.But now I have to buy mineral water and what is worse,
I have not washed my dirty clothes for nearly three days.This water issue really causes too much trouble to my life.Based on our contract,you should cover
the repair.

So, would you please come over to check the water system as soon as possible?
My wife and I will be really appreciated for your help and kindness.
If you can come,please tell me the specific time and I will wait at home.

I really look forward to hearing from you soon.

Your sincerely,
Sam

Team,

During this global crisis, our priorities are:

?	Our People, Company
?	Our Customers, Partners, and the Industry
?	Our Culture

OUR PEOPLE, COMPANY
Our primary concern is the safety, health, and well-being of you and your families. With COVID-19 having far-reaching effects on our daily lives, it is essential that we take special care of ourselves and our loved ones. I know we are all aware and experiencing the burdens of working remotely during this time, and the company is here for you to ensure you have access to the tools, resources, and support you need.

I want to thank everyone for the tremendous effort you are making to keep our business going strong under the most challenging of circumstances. Everyone has an important role to play and is stepping up in creative and collaborative ways to support our company and our customers. Since joining the company just five weeks ago, I have truly been amazed at and extremely proud of the response and resilience of our teams around the world.

At the core of our DNA is the ability to build mission-critical capabilities. This DNA is more valuable for us now than ever before as we navigate a new normal. If we lean into the possibilities in these moments and recognize that this new normal is being created, then we can tap into the skills, mindsets, and relationships that are part of our core strengths. Be tolerant of each other and our new working environments. We will get through this difficult time together, and I’m optimistic that we can learn, adapt, and adjust so we emerge as a better, stronger, and more unified Wind River as a result of it.

OUR CUSTOMER, PARTNERS, AND THE INDUSTRY
As this crisis unfolds, Wind River’s commitment to help the world run better and improve people’s lives has never been more important. We continue to deliver solutions for mission-critical systems that help safeguard and protect the global population. To help our customers, partners, and the industry at large, we’ll be launching an important initiative early next week intended to help companies navigate and adapt to this challenging new climate, including those directly responding to the COVID-19 crisis. This is our chance to underscore Wind River’s collective and focused commitment to the industry to let them know we care and that they can count on Wind River. I’ll be sharing more details soon…stay tuned.

OUR CULTURE
Today we kick off our Wind Way monthly theme of ‘We Care.’ I can’t think of a time when this guiding principle would be more important and relevant than it is now. From our families, friends, and colleagues to our customers, partners, and communities, showing how much we care right now is more critical than ever. The team will introduce a series of initiatives in support of this guiding principle that they will be sharing with you soon.

Please take care of yourself and those around you, and we will continue to provide you with regular updates as we move forward.

All my best for the ongoing health and safety of you and your loved ones,

======================================================================

As we remain laser focused on FY20 and our ongoing growth goal, I’ve spent a lot of time working to ensure we have the right sales leadership in place to help drive our initiatives forward. To that end, I am very excited and pleased to announce that Jegan Arthanari has been promoted to Vice President, Worldwide Field Engineering.

Jegan has been part of the Wind River family for 22 years, he is a valued and trusted leader who has the passion, determination, and dedication to inspire and encourage his team, and has had a significant impact on the success of Wind River. He plays a critical role in the growth and development of his team, helping Wind River navigate complex situations like Urgent 11, and driving product requirements into our roadmap.

Always demonstrating strong leadership, Jegan has built an incredibly talented and hard-working global Field Engineering team that our customers rely on for their development of the most advanced, mission-critical systems in the world.  I am honored to have him as a partner, and look forward to his continued success.

Please join me in congratulating Jegan on this well-deserved promotion.

============================================================================
Hi Dong & Peng & Folks,

I have a suggestion and request relating to our networking
benchmarking testing, and also relating to development efforts
to improve networking performance.

In the iperf3 performance tests, we currently do not have very good
testing for receive (RX) performance.  Currently there are four tests
performed:
?	TCP 64 (RX)
?	TCP 1024 (TX)
?	TCP 65536 (TX)
?	UDP 1400 (TX)

All of the tests run between a VxWorks target (iperf3 client)
and a Linux server (iperf3 server).

Of the 4 tests, on ly the TCP 64 (RX) test involves the VxWorks target
receiving.  The linux server host sends TCP data to the client.  However,

- The test restricts sends by the server and receives by the client to 64 bytes.
- The Nagle algorithm is disabled, in an effort to avoid coalescing of sends resulting
   in full-sized segments being transmitted on the wire.
- The socket buffer sizes are left at the OS default, which means 60000 bytes
   on VxWorks.

This is not a test aimed at measuring the best receive performance
of the VxWorks target, or even measuring typical TCP receive performance.
The limitation of the send/receive size and the disabling of the Nagle algoritm
are instead handicaps aimed at stressing the RX I/O path in the stack, sockets,
and I/O layers.

To be fair, for 1Gbit/s Ethernet, I suspect that most VxWorks targets are
fast enough to support TCP receive at the rough maximum rate of  ~941 Mbit/s
so one would not see much difference amongst targets, and would also
not easily see any effect from a small stack performance gain or drop,
so long as the target could still support the line-rate limited ~941 Mbit/s.

However, this does not apply for 10Gbit/s Ethernet, where most
VxWorks targets are still CPU limited rather than wire-limited.  I think
we should add realistic TCP RX performance testing  for a selection
of VxWorks targets capable of 10Gbit/s Ethernet.  This testing should
aim at typical or best-case throughput (with MTU 1500) rather than
handicapping the system with small sends, small receives,  disabled Nagle,
and small (for 10Gbit/s) socket buffers.

[Note that the TCP 64 (RX) test also has another issue.  Disabling the Nagle
algorithm does not fully succeed in avoiding coalescing of sends by the
Linux sender.  On the wire, one sees segments that are often considerably
larger than the 64-bytes of TCP payload data per send. The Linux sender
is more successful in coalescing sends when sending against a slower
receiver, which has the perverse effect that for at least some ranges of
receiver performance, speeding up the reciever decreases the TX coalescing,
makes segments on th ewire smaller, and so decreases the actual throughput.
However, I think it is better to add a new test exercising  10Gbit/s receive by
VxWorks rather than completely getting rid of the current TCP 64 (RX) test,
although I would like to see the TCP 64 (RX) test de-emphasized.]

I think it also makes sense to add a set of tests in which VxWorks acts
as both receiver and sender.   Linux and VxWorks have different
properties as TCP senders -- in particular, VxWorks does not (yet) support
TCP segmentation offload, a.k.a. TCP large send.  It is worthwhile to
test VxWorks against not only Linux but also against VxWorks.
(Runing a TCP throughput test between two VxWorks targets
also has the benefit of simultaneously testing VxWorks sending and
receiving.)  A UDP throughput test measuring successfully received
RX throughput rather than TX throughput is another possibility.

I would suggest starting with two relatively fast, identical Intel
boards connected by Intel 82599-based NICs (tei driver) via
fibre.  The boards would be in VLM and (ideally) each could boot
into either VxWorks or linux.  Later, other targets with 10Gbit/s
capable network interfaces could be added.  We could add
TCP throughput tests between two such VxWorks targets
to our official iperf3 test repertoire.

I would like such connected target pairs available in VLM
for remote networking  development as well as for official network throughput
testing.   I have a tentative improvement in the TCP receive side on
SMP targets that in preliminary testing (on Intel targets with tei
interfaces in my WRS office), showed more than doubled TCP throughput
between the two SMP VXWorks targets.  However, I was not able to
take those targets home with me, and cannot develop on them remotely.
That's my "selfish" reason for this request; I would like to continue
that work, but currently I am not aware of such a pair of 10Gbit/s
connected targets available via VLM.

Anyhow, that's what I think would be useful for networking
performance development and testing.

Thanks,

======================================Bill Gates blog
There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact on how soon case numbers start to go down, how long the economy remains shut down and how many Americans will have to bury a loved one because of COVID-19.

Our foundation has been working to slow the outbreak for several months. To date, we’ve invested $105 million in efforts to create new therapeutics, expand access to testing, and limit the virus’s impact here in Seattle.

As a result of this work, I’ve spoken with experts and leaders in Washington and across the country. It’s become clear to me that we must take three steps.

First, we need a consistent nationwide approach to shutting down. Despite urging from public health experts, some states and counties haven’t shut down completely. In some states, beaches are still open; in others, restaurants still serve sit-down meals.

This is a recipe for disaster. Because people can travel freely across state lines, so can the virus. The country’s leaders need to be clear: Shutdown anywhere means shutdown everywhere. Until the case numbers start to go down across America―which could take 10 weeks or more―no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown. Any confusion about this point will only extend the economic pain, raise the odds that the virus will return, and cause more deaths.

Second, the federal government needs to step up on testing. Far more tests should be made available. We should also aggregate the results so we can quickly identify potential volunteers for clinical trials and know with confidence when it’s time to return to normal. There are good examples to follow: New York state recently expanded its capacity to more than 25,000 tests per day.

There’s also been some progress on more efficient testing methods, such as the self-swab developed by the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network, which allows patients to take a sample themselves without possibly exposing a health worker. I hope this and other innovations in testing are scaled up across the country soon.

Even so, demand for tests will probably exceed the supply for some time, and right now, there’s little rhyme or reason to who gets the few that are available. As a result, we don’t have a good handle on how many cases there are or where the virus is likely headed next, and it will be hard to know if it rebounds later. And because of the backlog of samples, it can take seven days for results to arrive when we need them within 24 hours.

This is why the country needs clear priorities for who is tested. First on the list should be people in essential roles such as health-care workers and first responders followed by highly symptomatic people who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill and those who are likely to have been exposed.

The same goes for masks and ventilators. Forcing 50 governors to compete for lifesaving equipment―and hospitals to pay exorbitant prices for it―only makes matters worse.

Finally, we need a data-based approach to developing treatments and a vaccine. Scientists are working full speed on both; in the meantime, leaders can help by not stoking rumors or panic buying. Long before the drug hydroxychloroquine was approved as an emergency treatment for COVID-19, people started hoarding it, making it hard to find for lupus patients who needed it to survive.

We should stick with the process that works: Run rapid trials involving various candidates and inform the public when the results are in. Once we have a safe and effective treatment, we’ll need to ensure that the first doses go to the people who need them most.

To bring the disease to an end, we’ll need a safe and effective vaccine. If we do everything right, we could have one in less than 18 months―the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. But creating a vaccine is only half the battle. To protect Americans and people around the world, we’ll need to manufacture billions of doses.

Without a vaccine, developing countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns. The further down the income ladder people live, the more important it is that they go to work every day just to feed their family.

If they live in the poorest parts of sub-Saharan Africa or India, staying home simply isn’t an option. Even if they do stay home, they can’t just wall themselves off from their neighbors; in slums, the houses are packed together so closely that there’s no way to keep your distance. All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in those places, too.

We can get a head start on manufacturing all of the doses we’ll need now by building the facilities where these vaccines will be made. Because many of the top candidates are made using unique equipment, we’ll have to build facilities for each of them, knowing that some won’t get used. Private companies can’t take that kind of risk, but the federal government can. It’s a great sign that the administration made deals this week with at least two companies to prepare for vaccine manufacturing. I hope more deals will follow.

In 2015, I urged world leaders in a TED talk to prepare for a pandemic the same way they prepare for war―by running simulations to find the cracks in the system. As we’ve seen this year, we have a long way to go. But I still believe that if we make the right decisions now, informed by science, data, and experience of medical professionals, we can save lives and get the country back to work.

==============================a good email template in office===
Dear xxxx,

The past few weeks have been heartbreaking for America, and a reminder that in 2020 we still live in a country with systemic racial inequality.

I have heard from many of you that have been deeply moved by these events. I wanted to take this opportunity to share a few thoughts with you.

My prayers and condolences go to the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Christian Cooper, and Breonna Taylor as the most recent victims, along with the communities that are being impacted by violence and hate.

When I see the faces of these victims, I see my three young sons and I’m reminded that just like their father they unfortunately will continue to be judged not by their character, but by the color of their skin. While the recent news events highlight the inequality from a law enforcement perspective, the problem unfortunately is “systemic,” where African Americans continue to be disadvantaged in terms of law enforcement and employment opportunities, particularly in tech, financial services, and healthcare.

In this day and age, we should not have to experience, or have our children, colleagues, friends or people we do not even know experience the worst of human behavior. A well-known African proverb says, “If we want to go fast, go alone. If we want to go far, go together.” We are collectively much better than this, and we must do better.

I am honored and proud to lead a company with a culture that truly cares about its people and communities, with a commitment to diversity and inclusion. Now more than ever, it is critical for us to stand united with one common interest C to make this a more just world for all by standing against inequality. As one Wind River team, we must be conscious of our biases, as well as uphold a standard of care and respect in both words and actions that lives up to our values and cultural attributes.

In the midst of a worldwide pandemic and economic crisis, we are already going through a tremendously challenging period, so please support each other, and know that you are not alone. It's important that we feel comfortable talking openly and listening respectfully on topics of race and justice at work, and that we show compassion and empathy. It’s also important that we take care of ourselves, and Wind River has resources to support mental health with our Employee Assistance Program (EAP).

We may not be able to mend all the broken parts of our society immediately, but we have a collective responsibility to be part of the solution to creating a better world by being the best versions of ourselves and bringing about change for equality and belonging. Stay informed and be part of the conversation. We are thinking through ways we can do more here too, and we welcome and encourage your thoughts.

Thank you for your continued commitment and dedication during this very challenging time, and please continue to keep yourselves and your loved ones safe.

Best Regards,
