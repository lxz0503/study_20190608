I am afraid not.You know I am a software engineer, so I have to sit in front of my computer all day long.

So I have to say my work is not interesting but it is full of challenge.

===========================what are your main responsibilities?  =============

My main work is related to software test and hardware test.

But sometimes I also provide technical support for customers if they are not clear about the useage of our products.


======what sorts of things do you do at work?

Before we release a software product to customers, I must do system test, which needs reviewing code,making comments and setting up test environment.

Finally I will give a detailed test report for this new product.Sometimes, if the customer is not clear about the usage, I also provide technical support through email or telephone.

====================Is work important to you?====

Yes, I think so. Work provides me with an income to support my family.You know I have a baby.

Also I can gain satisfaction and achievement in my work,especially after I resolve a tough issue.

======Have you received any training related to your work?

To be an interpreter, I can interact with different people from different cultures.

Also I can broaden my horizons and enrich my knowledge.

I know this is really hard for me,but I will have a try.

=================================== what job would you like to have in the future?

Well, I wish I could become an English interpreter in 5 years.  

English is always my biggest interest besides my daily work. I would like to interact with different people from different cultures.

I think I need more professional trainings to fulfil my dream. There is still a long way to go.

===== how do you usually spend your eveninigs??

I usually get home around 7 PM. Then I will prepare dinner with my wife.I enjoy the process of cooking.

After dinner, I will take care of my baby.It is very fun. Sometimes I can have a big gift if there is an important football game.

==================do you like to go out in the evenings?

Yes, I like to go out in the evenings. Because my home is very close to a beautiful river.Many people are jogging along the river at night.

Also there is the famous square dance,sometimes my wife and my mother will join. But since I had a baby, I rarely went out at night.

You know I have to take care of my little baby.

=============what do people today usually like to do after work?

Many people of my age are pretty tired after work and just want to have some exercise time and quiet rest time to renew their bodies and spirits.(to recharge batteries)

So, they can feel refreshed  and energetic in the next morning.

======== what about you?

I find that I am so tired after a day's work.So I just want to relax. Like watching entertaining TV programmes(BBC documentaries ), listening to light music,reading simple novels.

Also taking care of my baby is a good way to reduce stress.Because baby is my biggest fun. 

============ Do you feel lonely if you stay at home for a long time?

I guess I would say no. Sometimes I enjoy being alone at home. I can do anything that I want to do, like watching my favorite NBA games,listening to rock&roll music,

or even practising my singing. Actually you know,this is a connecting society, if you want to interact with outside world, just pick up your mobile phone and make a call,send a message,

I love sunny days with clear blue skies.I like mild temperatures.

=== what type of weather do Chinese people usually like?

I think it varies according to age, where they live,and what they love to do in their spare time. 

I find this a hard question to answer since there are so many people in China.

====Which is your least favorite season?

I don't like winter because of the low temperature. You must wear warm and heavy clothes to go out, otherwise, you can just stay at home.

Many trees and flowers seem to be dead without vitality. If there is a heavy snow, the traffic will go into disaster. 

Anyway, this season makes me feel depressed.

======what do you often do on sunny days??

Well,My home is very close to a river, so I like to have a jog along the river and,at the same time, I can enjoy the beautiful trees and flowers.

Sometimes I ride my motorbike to work, which you can enjoy the breeze on your face, it is very comfortable.

====And on cold days?



====what is the weather like in your city?

Well, It has four distinct seasons in my city. Spring and Autumn are comfortable and mild. you can do any outdoor activities and enjoy the beautiful nature.

Summer is really hot, while Winter is too cold.You had better do indoor activities in these two seasons. 

===wear watch?

=== I prefer to use my cellphone.I think the function of a watch has changed. It was often used to display time in the past,but now, it is mostly for decoration or a symbol of status.

If you work in financial field, you must wear suit and watch,but for me, a software engineer, it is not necessary.

===Do you think it is important to be on time?

Yes, I think it is pretty important to be on time. It is a way to respect others and let them know they are important.

Another example, if you are late for a train or a fligh, the train or flight will never wait for you.

So, remeber, being punctual is good for you.

=====how do you feel when you are late for an appointment?

I feel very sorry and embarrassed. Actually if I was going to be late, I would make a call in advance to explain why. You know sometimes the traffic jam can last several hours.

so if you don't wanto be late, just forget your car and take the subway.

If I was really late, I would buy some small gifts to express my apology.

=====How do you feel when others are late?

When others are late, if they have sound(legitimate) reasons, I can understand. I know sometimes the traffic condition is really bad.

But if they are just getting up late or some personal issue, I  feel  a bit irritated. I think it is not respecting others. 

If I am a manager, I will punish him or her to sing a song for us.

=====your hometown

where are you from?

I am from a small village in Qinhuangdao, It is in the northeast of China.
